Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
    boolean - true/false, hold 1-bit
    int - whole numbers, can hold 32-bit
    double - numbers containing a decimal, can hold 64-bit
    float - numbers containing a decimal, abbreviated, can hold 64-bit
    char - character, 16-bit displayed like 'this'
    long - integer, can hold 64-bit
    short - integer, can hold 16-bit
    byte - integer, can hold 8-bit

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
    int x = 42

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
    it will add a decimal (.0) to end of the int

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
    casting ie. double x = 10.0 int y = (int) x

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
    * / + - %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
    compares values to one another - will produce true/false

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
    x = 1 y = 8
    if(x < y) sout("x < y");

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
    for boolean operands, produces a boolean

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
    x = true y = false
    if(x ^ y) sout("only one or the other is true")

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
    x += 10

11.) What data type is a String?
    object

12.) Are strings mutable?
    no, they are immutable

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
    using "this one " + "and this one"

14.) Can you cast an int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?
    no, an int is a primitive data type and a String is an object that defines and supports character strings

15.) What is an array?

16.) What is the first index of an array?

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
